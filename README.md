# AlarmClock
This code allows a user to input the current time and desired alarm time (both in military time). After that input, the code will keep time, printing an update each minute, until the alarm time is reached. Then, the alarm (built-in LED and a piezo speaker, if attached) will be triggered and will loop indefinitely.
